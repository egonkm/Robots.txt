# We don't use wildcards here, because some crawlers don't support wildcards;
# instead we list every supported locale.

# crawling the norm /en/projects.json and /en/projects/*.json files.
# However, it's pointless to get them in different locales, so
# only crawl one locale, namely English (en), and the "no locale" version.

# Don't crawl /projects URLs with "&" or "%".
# We get many attacks that use these characters, and in some cases
# temporarily block sites that use them in ways that look like attacks.
# There's no need to crawl them, and by saying "do not crawl them"
# we protect web crawlers from accidentally looking like attackers.
# Ideally we'd only prevent crawling if these were not part of the query,
# but robots.txt doesn't have any way to do that.
